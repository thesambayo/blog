description: "Documenting what I have learnt so far since I began my self-study to Computer science"

> This post is updated as I learn.

A while ago, I [wrote about my background deficiency](/posts/my-computer-science-study-program/) in my profession as a Software engineer and how I have decided to address this deficiency.

### Table of contents

## Highlight table

This table that contains the topics I'm learning and aspects of these topics I have covered. In the same table will be links to either resources I find critical to learning some of these aspects or links to things I have made with them.

| Topics               | Aspects                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data structures      | [Linked lists](/posts/what-is-the-linked-lists-data-structure), Queues, Stacks |
| Sorting algorithms   | Bubble sort                                                                    |
| Searching algorithms | Linear search, Binary search (+ 2 crystal problem)                             |
| Design patterns      | Creational patterns(singleton, functional options)                                               |

## Go-kata-machine

I'm going through the free Frontend masters course, [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/). This course was taught in JavaScript but I have written some of the topics in Golang. So I build an equivalent of the Kata-machine used in the course. You can find it with the test in this [repository that I have called go-kata-machine](https://github.com/thesambayo/go-kata-machine).

You should be able to generate a day directory which will contain each course topic package and tests to know whether you solution to the topic questions are correct.

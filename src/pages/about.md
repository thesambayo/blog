I specialize in full-stack development with Golang, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, leading technical initiatives from system architecture to delivery.

When I'm not architecting software solutions, I enjoy spending time with my wife, writing technical blog posts about software engineering best practices, watching football, and exploring new technologies that could solve tomorrow's problems.
